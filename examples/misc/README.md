# Miscellaneous examples and tutorials

This directory contains a few examples and tutorials on some secondary
aspects of OpenPathSampling.

* [`committors.ipynb`](http://github.com/openpathsampling/openpathsampling/blob/master/examples/misc/committors.ipynb)
  How to use OPS for committor analysis, and to analyze the shooting points
  from a path sampling simulation.
