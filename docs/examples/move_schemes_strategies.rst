Understanding Move Schemes and Strategies
=========================================

The :class:`.MoveScheme` and :class:`MoveStrategy` objects provide powerful
flexibility in designing your path sampling simulation. They are intended to
be very straightforward to use. However, they are not so straightforward to
implement. This notebook describes how they work internally, and should help
developers create new schemes and strategies.
