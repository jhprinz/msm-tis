Continuing a Path Sampling Simulation
=====================================

You'll often want to continue a simulation -- either because there was a
problem with a previous simulation, or because you'd decided you need more
data than was captured in an initial run.

Like most codes, OpenPathSampling makes it easy for you to continue from a
previous simulation. The example we show here is based on the :ref:`alanine
dipeptide MSTIS example <AD-mstis>`.
