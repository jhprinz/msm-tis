Data Objects
============

This describes some of the objects used to describe data. Note that
:class:`Trajectories <.Trajectory>` and :class:`Snapshots <.Snapshot>` are
described in the :ref:`Engines <engine>` section.

A less-technical overview is provided in the :ref:`data-objects` section of
the user guide; we recommend that you read that first.
