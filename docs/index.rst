OpenPathSampling
================

A Python library to facilitate path sampling algorithms. 

OpenPathSampling (OPS) makes it easy to perform many variants of transition
path sampling (TPS) and transition interface sampling (TIS), as well as
other useful calculations for rare events, such as committor analysis and
flux calculations. In addition, it is a powerful library to build new path
sampling methods.

OPS is independent of the underlying molecular dynamics engine, and
currently has support for OpenMM, as well as an internal engine suitable for
2D toy models.

To learn more about what OPS can do, look at our :ref:`examples <examples>`.
If you want to jump right in, take a look at how easy it is to

OPS is an open-source project, distributed under the LGPL. Join us in
the development process on GitHub_.
