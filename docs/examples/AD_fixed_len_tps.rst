Fixed Length TPS on Alanine Dipeptide
=====================================

Although fixed length TPS was developed before flexible length TPS, it is
actually a little harder to set up. It is also less efficient, so under most
circumstances it is better to use flexible-length TPS.

Note that the first notebook here is the same as is used in the flexible
length TPS example. In addition, the notebooks to run the simulation and to
analyze it are also very similar to the flexible length example.
