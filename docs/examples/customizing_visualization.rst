Customizing Visualizations
==========================

As is shown in the examples, OpenPathSampling includes several useful tools
for visualization aspects of the calculation. In particular, there is the
move "decision tree" visualizer, which provides a visual layout of the move
scheme being used, and the path "history tree" visualizer, which gives an
overview of what happened to a given replica during a path sampling
simulation.

The following two examples show how to use and customize each of those
visualization tools.
