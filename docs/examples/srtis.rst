Single Replica TIS on a Toy Model
=================================

This continues the work from the :ref:`toy MSTIS <toy-mstis>` example.
Taking the results from that, we can create a fixed bias single replica TIS
simulation.

Normally you would iterate the fixed bias calculation several times in order
to converge toward a flat histogram. In this particular example, we start
with a well-converged result from the previous example, so we don't need to
iterate.
